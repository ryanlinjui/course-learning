1
00:00:12,760 --> 00:00:14,736
Sadly,

2
00:00:14,760 --> 00:00:18,023
in the next 18 minutes when I do our chat,

3
00:00:18,047 --> 00:00:20,736
four Americans that are alive

4
00:00:20,760 --> 00:00:23,808
will be dead through the food that they eat.

5
00:00:26,451 --> 00:00:27,826
My name's Jamie Oliver.

6
00:00:27,850 --> 00:00:28,983
I'm 34 years old.

7
00:00:29,601 --> 00:00:31,736
I'm from Essex in England

8
00:00:31,760 --> 00:00:34,736
and for the last seven years

9
00:00:34,760 --> 00:00:40,118
I've worked fairly tirelessly to save lives in my own way.

10
00:00:40,944 --> 00:00:42,736
I'm not a doctor;

11
00:00:42,760 --> 00:00:43,937
I'm a chef,

12
00:00:43,961 --> 00:00:46,483
I don't have expensive equipment

13
00:00:46,507 --> 00:00:47,577
or medicine.

14
00:00:47,601 --> 00:00:49,846
I use information, education.

15
00:00:51,085 --> 00:00:54,062
I profoundly believe that the power of food

16
00:00:54,086 --> 00:00:57,261
has a primal place in our homes

17
00:00:57,285 --> 00:01:01,736
that binds us to the best bits of life.

18
00:01:03,680 --> 00:01:09,050
We have an awful, awful reality right now.

19
00:01:10,339 --> 00:01:13,315
America, you're at the top of your game.

20
00:01:13,760 --> 00:01:16,747
This is one of the most unhealthy countries in the world.

21
00:01:17,450 --> 00:01:20,096
Can I please just see a raise of hands

22
00:01:20,120 --> 00:01:22,699
for how many of you have children in this room today?

23
00:01:22,723 --> 00:01:23,823
Put your hands up.

24
00:01:24,148 --> 00:01:27,533
You can continue to put your hands up, aunties and uncles as well.

25
00:01:28,092 --> 00:01:30,069
Most of you. OK.

26
00:01:30,093 --> 00:01:33,070
We, the adults of the last four generations,

27
00:01:33,094 --> 00:01:35,959
have blessed our children with the destiny

28
00:01:35,983 --> 00:01:40,315
of a shorter lifespan than their own parents.

29
00:01:41,839 --> 00:01:46,736
Your child will live a life ten years younger than you

30
00:01:46,760 --> 00:01:49,736
because of the landscape of food that we've built around them.

31
00:01:51,155 --> 00:01:52,640
Two-thirds of this room,

32
00:01:52,664 --> 00:01:55,640
today, in America, are statistically overweight or obese.

33
00:01:55,994 --> 00:01:57,241
You lot, you're all right,

34
00:01:57,265 --> 00:01:59,280
but we'll get you eventually, don't worry.

35
00:01:59,304 --> 00:02:00,736
(Laughter)

36
00:02:00,760 --> 00:02:03,736
The statistics of bad health are clear,

37
00:02:03,760 --> 00:02:04,951
very clear.

38
00:02:05,569 --> 00:02:09,193
We spend our lives being paranoid about death, murder, homicide,

39
00:02:09,217 --> 00:02:12,736
you name it; it's on the front page of every paper, CNN.

40
00:02:12,760 --> 00:02:15,253
Look at homicide at the bottom, for God's sake.

41
00:02:16,158 --> 00:02:17,189
Right?

42
00:02:17,213 --> 00:02:18,736
(Laughter)

43
00:02:18,760 --> 00:02:23,736
(Applause)

44
00:02:23,760 --> 00:02:28,076
Every single one of those in the red is a diet-related disease.

45
00:02:28,100 --> 00:02:30,688
Any doctor, any specialist will tell you that.

46
00:02:30,712 --> 00:02:33,999
Fact: diet-related disease is the biggest killer

47
00:02:34,023 --> 00:02:37,174
in the United States, right now, here today.

48
00:02:39,865 --> 00:02:41,322
This is a global problem.

49
00:02:42,330 --> 00:02:43,482
It's a catastrophe.

50
00:02:43,506 --> 00:02:44,974
It's sweeping the world.

51
00:02:44,998 --> 00:02:47,211
England is right behind you, as usual.

52
00:02:47,973 --> 00:02:52,180
(Laughter)

53
00:02:52,204 --> 00:02:54,227
I know they were close, but not that close.

54
00:02:54,926 --> 00:02:56,274
We need a revolution.

55
00:02:56,298 --> 00:02:58,577
Mexico, Australia, Germany,

56
00:02:58,601 --> 00:02:59,829
India, China,

57
00:02:59,853 --> 00:03:02,964
all have massive problems of obesity and bad health.

58
00:03:04,545 --> 00:03:05,736
Think about smoking.

59
00:03:06,854 --> 00:03:08,736
It costs way less than obesity now.

60
00:03:09,497 --> 00:03:14,407
Obesity costs you Americans 10 percent of your health-care bills,

61
00:03:14,431 --> 00:03:17,152
150 billion dollars a year.

62
00:03:18,834 --> 00:03:20,736
In 10 years, it's set to double:

63
00:03:20,760 --> 00:03:22,253
300 billion dollars a year.

64
00:03:22,277 --> 00:03:24,653
Let's be honest, guys, you haven't got that cash.

65
00:03:24,677 --> 00:03:27,793
(Laughter)

66
00:03:28,585 --> 00:03:34,976
I came here to start a food revolution that I so profoundly believe in.

67
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:37,255
We need it. The time is now.

68
00:03:37,279 --> 00:03:39,006
We're in a tipping-point moment.

69
00:03:39,030 --> 00:03:40,815
I've been doing this for seven years.

70
00:03:40,839 --> 00:03:43,002
I've been trying in America for seven years.

71
00:03:43,026 --> 00:03:46,910
Now is the time when it's ripe -- ripe for the picking.

72
00:03:46,934 --> 00:03:48,736
I went to the eye of the storm.

73
00:03:48,760 --> 00:03:51,689
I went to West Virginia, the most unhealthy state in America.

74
00:03:51,713 --> 00:03:52,752
Or it was last year.

75
00:03:52,776 --> 00:03:56,015
We've got a new one this year, but we'll work on that next season.

76
00:03:56,039 --> 00:03:57,922
(Laughter)

77
00:03:57,946 --> 00:03:59,969
Huntington, West Virginia. Beautiful town.

78
00:03:59,993 --> 00:04:03,490
I wanted to put heart and soul and people,

79
00:04:03,514 --> 00:04:05,269
your public,

80
00:04:05,293 --> 00:04:08,784
around the statistics that we've become so used to.

81
00:04:09,164 --> 00:04:12,164
I want to introduce you to some of the people that I care about:

82
00:04:12,188 --> 00:04:13,808
your public, your children.

83
00:04:13,832 --> 00:04:16,381
I want to show a picture of my friend Brittany.

84
00:04:16,405 --> 00:04:18,078
She's 16 years old.

85
00:04:18,688 --> 00:04:22,178
She's got six years to live

86
00:04:22,202 --> 00:04:24,736
because of the food that she's eaten.

87
00:04:25,044 --> 00:04:27,148
She's the third generation of Americans

88
00:04:27,172 --> 00:04:29,363
that hasn't grown up within a food environment

89
00:04:29,387 --> 00:04:31,976
where they've been taught to cook at home or in school,

90
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:34,007
or her mom, or her mom's mom.

91
00:04:34,031 --> 00:04:36,213
She has six years to live.

92
00:04:37,347 --> 00:04:39,521
She's eating her liver to death.

93
00:04:40,220 --> 00:04:41,656
Stacy, the Edwards family.

94
00:04:42,173 --> 00:04:44,021
This is a normal family, guys.

95
00:04:44,760 --> 00:04:47,586
Stacy does her best, but she's third-generation as well;

96
00:04:47,610 --> 00:04:49,959
she was never taught to cook at home or at school.

97
00:04:49,983 --> 00:04:51,118
The family's obese.

98
00:04:51,142 --> 00:04:53,863
Justin here, 12 years old, he's 350 pounds.

99
00:04:53,887 --> 00:04:55,555
He gets bullied, for God's sake.

100
00:04:55,579 --> 00:04:58,046
The daughter there, Katie, she's four years old.

101
00:04:58,070 --> 00:05:00,578
She's obese before she even gets to primary school.

102
00:05:01,094 --> 00:05:03,736
Marissa, she's all right, she's one of your lot.

103
00:05:04,042 --> 00:05:05,065
But you know what?

104
00:05:05,089 --> 00:05:08,447
Her father, who was obese, died in her arms,

105
00:05:08,471 --> 00:05:10,875
And then the second most important man in her life,

106
00:05:10,899 --> 00:05:13,423
her uncle, died of obesity,

107
00:05:13,447 --> 00:05:15,352
and now her step-dad is obese.

108
00:05:16,537 --> 00:05:18,313
You see, the thing is,

109
00:05:18,337 --> 00:05:20,736
obesity and diet-related disease

110
00:05:20,760 --> 00:05:22,760
doesn't just hurt the people that have it;

111
00:05:22,784 --> 00:05:25,409
it's all of their friends, families, brothers, sisters.

112
00:05:26,973 --> 00:05:28,736
Pastor Steve:

113
00:05:28,760 --> 00:05:30,197
an inspirational man,

114
00:05:30,221 --> 00:05:32,735
one of my early allies in Huntington, West Virginia.

115
00:05:33,091 --> 00:05:36,543
He's at the sharp knife-edge of this problem.

116
00:05:37,035 --> 00:05:39,019
He has to bury the people, OK?

117
00:05:39,392 --> 00:05:40,572
And he's fed up with it.

118
00:05:40,596 --> 00:05:43,638
He's fed up with burying his friends, his family, his community.

119
00:05:43,947 --> 00:05:46,895
Come winter, three times as many people die.

120
00:05:47,276 --> 00:05:48,331
He's sick of it.

121
00:05:48,760 --> 00:05:51,426
This is preventable disease. Waste of life.

122
00:05:51,760 --> 00:05:53,839
By the way, this is what they get buried in.

123
00:05:55,085 --> 00:05:56,768
We're not geared up to do this.

124
00:05:57,863 --> 00:06:00,491
Can't even get them out the door, and I'm being serious.

125
00:06:00,515 --> 00:06:02,236
Can't even get them there. Forklift.

126
00:06:03,292 --> 00:06:05,384
OK, I see it as a triangle, OK?

127
00:06:05,408 --> 00:06:06,940
This is our landscape of food.

128
00:06:06,964 --> 00:06:08,321
I need you to understand it.

129
00:06:08,345 --> 00:06:10,409
You've probably heard all this before.

130
00:06:10,433 --> 00:06:11,719
Over the last 30 years,

131
00:06:11,743 --> 00:06:14,576
what's happened that's ripped the heart out of this country?

132
00:06:14,600 --> 00:06:15,841
Let's be frank and honest.

133
00:06:17,284 --> 00:06:19,484
Well, modern-day life.

134
00:06:19,508 --> 00:06:21,133
Let's start with the Main Street.

135
00:06:21,887 --> 00:06:24,571
Fast food has taken over the whole country; we know that.

136
00:06:24,595 --> 00:06:27,399
The big brands are some of the most important powers,

137
00:06:27,423 --> 00:06:29,263
powerful powers, in this country.

138
00:06:29,873 --> 00:06:30,874
(Sighs)

139
00:06:30,898 --> 00:06:32,197
Supermarkets as well.

140
00:06:32,640 --> 00:06:34,616
Big companies. Big companies.

141
00:06:35,031 --> 00:06:37,991
Thirty years ago, most of the food

142
00:06:38,015 --> 00:06:40,736
was largely local and largely fresh.

143
00:06:40,760 --> 00:06:44,119
Now it's largely processed and full of all sorts of additives,

144
00:06:44,143 --> 00:06:46,834
extra ingredients, and you know the rest of the story.

145
00:06:46,858 --> 00:06:49,736
Portion size is obviously a massive, massive problem.

146
00:06:51,437 --> 00:06:53,276
Labeling is a massive problem.

147
00:06:54,093 --> 00:06:56,260
The labeling in this country is a disgrace.

148
00:06:57,250 --> 00:07:01,705
The industry wants to self-police themselves.

149
00:07:02,760 --> 00:07:05,315
What, in this kind of climate? They don't deserve it.

150
00:07:05,339 --> 00:07:08,605
How can you say something is low-fat when it's full of so much sugar?

151
00:07:09,831 --> 00:07:10,851
Home.

152
00:07:13,033 --> 00:07:14,608
The biggest problem with the home

153
00:07:14,632 --> 00:07:19,736
is that used to be the heart of passing on food culture,

154
00:07:19,760 --> 00:07:22,184
what made our society.

155
00:07:22,208 --> 00:07:23,641
That is not happening anymore.

156
00:07:23,665 --> 00:07:26,546
And you know, as we go to work and as life changes,

157
00:07:26,570 --> 00:07:28,547
and as life always evolves,

158
00:07:28,571 --> 00:07:30,684
we kind of have to look at it holistically --

159
00:07:30,708 --> 00:07:33,096
step back for a moment, and re-address the balance.

160
00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:35,183
It hasn't happened for 30 years, OK?

161
00:07:36,164 --> 00:07:39,522
I want to show you a situation

162
00:07:39,546 --> 00:07:42,787
that is very normal right now; the Edwards family.

163
00:07:43,402 --> 00:07:45,378
(Video) Jamie Oliver: Let's have a talk.

164
00:07:46,232 --> 00:07:50,265
This stuff goes through you and your family's body every week.

165
00:07:50,289 --> 00:07:52,198
And I need you to know

166
00:07:52,222 --> 00:07:55,792
that this is going to kill your children early.

167
00:07:56,370 --> 00:07:57,760
How are you feeling?

168
00:07:58,459 --> 00:08:01,736
Stacy: Just feeling really sad and depressed right now.

169
00:08:02,450 --> 00:08:05,563
But, you know, I want my kids to succeed in life

170
00:08:05,587 --> 00:08:07,736
and this isn't going to get them there.

171
00:08:08,569 --> 00:08:10,065
But I'm killing them.

172
00:08:11,475 --> 00:08:14,451
JO: Yes you are. You are.

173
00:08:14,475 --> 00:08:15,687
But we can stop that.

174
00:08:19,577 --> 00:08:20,651
Normal.

175
00:08:21,826 --> 00:08:23,660
Let's get on schools,

176
00:08:23,684 --> 00:08:26,736
something that I'm fairly much a specialist in.

177
00:08:26,760 --> 00:08:28,297
OK, school.

178
00:08:28,760 --> 00:08:31,736
What is school? Who invented it? What's the purpose of school?

179
00:08:31,760 --> 00:08:34,592
School was always invented to arm us with the tools

180
00:08:34,616 --> 00:08:37,435
to make us creative, do wonderful things,

181
00:08:37,459 --> 00:08:39,916
make us earn a living, etc., etc.

182
00:08:39,940 --> 00:08:44,098
You know, it's been kind of in this sort of tight box for a long, long time, OK?

183
00:08:44,760 --> 00:08:46,736
But we haven't really evolved it

184
00:08:46,760 --> 00:08:50,090
to deal with the health catastrophes of America, OK?

185
00:08:50,114 --> 00:08:53,201
School food is something

186
00:08:53,225 --> 00:08:55,883
that most kids -- 31 million a day, actually --

187
00:08:55,907 --> 00:09:00,568
have twice a day, more than often, breakfast and lunch,

188
00:09:00,592 --> 00:09:02,321
180 days of the year.

189
00:09:02,345 --> 00:09:05,520
So you could say that school food is quite important, really,

190
00:09:05,544 --> 00:09:07,130
judging the circumstances.

191
00:09:07,154 --> 00:09:11,170
(Laughter)

192
00:09:12,219 --> 00:09:14,736
Before I crack into my rant,

193
00:09:14,760 --> 00:09:16,786
which I'm sure you're waiting for --

194
00:09:16,810 --> 00:09:19,857
(Laughter)

195
00:09:19,881 --> 00:09:22,247
I need to say one thing, and it's so important

196
00:09:22,271 --> 00:09:24,978
in, hopefully, the magic that happens and unfolds

197
00:09:25,002 --> 00:09:26,215
in the next three months.

198
00:09:26,760 --> 00:09:30,049
The lunch ladies, the lunch cooks of America --

199
00:09:30,073 --> 00:09:33,448
I offer myself as their ambassador.

200
00:09:33,472 --> 00:09:34,958
I'm not slagging them off.

201
00:09:34,982 --> 00:09:36,982
They're doing the best they can do.

202
00:09:39,648 --> 00:09:41,060
They're doing their best.

203
00:09:41,760 --> 00:09:43,592
But they're doing what they're told,

204
00:09:43,616 --> 00:09:45,877
and what they're being told to do is wrong.

205
00:09:46,196 --> 00:09:49,433
The system is highly run by accountants;

206
00:09:49,457 --> 00:09:53,534
there's not enough, or any, food-knowledgeable people in the business.

207
00:09:53,558 --> 00:09:54,589
There's a problem:

208
00:09:54,613 --> 00:09:57,736
If you're not a food expert, and you've got tight budgets

209
00:09:57,760 --> 00:10:00,470
and it's getting tighter, then you can't be creative,

210
00:10:00,494 --> 00:10:03,633
you can't duck and dive and write different things around things.

211
00:10:03,657 --> 00:10:05,664
If you're an accountant, and a box-ticker,

212
00:10:05,688 --> 00:10:07,934
the only thing you can do in these circumstances

213
00:10:07,958 --> 00:10:08,986
is buy cheaper shit.

214
00:10:09,010 --> 00:10:10,340
Now, the reality is,

215
00:10:10,364 --> 00:10:13,975
the food that your kids get every day is fast food,

216
00:10:13,999 --> 00:10:15,308
it's highly processed,

217
00:10:15,332 --> 00:10:17,572
there's not enough fresh food in there at all.

218
00:10:17,596 --> 00:10:19,777
You know, the amount of additives, E numbers,

219
00:10:19,801 --> 00:10:21,507
ingredients you wouldn't believe --

220
00:10:21,531 --> 00:10:23,242
there's not enough veggies at all.

221
00:10:23,266 --> 00:10:25,190
French fries are considered a vegetable.

222
00:10:25,214 --> 00:10:27,736
Pizza for breakfast. They don't even get crockery.

223
00:10:27,760 --> 00:10:30,092
Knives and forks? No, they're too dangerous.

224
00:10:30,917 --> 00:10:32,657
They have scissors in the classroom,

225
00:10:32,681 --> 00:10:34,062
but knives and forks? No.

226
00:10:34,086 --> 00:10:35,482
And the way I look at it is:

227
00:10:35,506 --> 00:10:37,895
If you don't have knives and forks in your school,

228
00:10:37,919 --> 00:10:39,458
you're purely endorsing,

229
00:10:39,482 --> 00:10:42,554
from a state level, fast food, because it's handheld.

230
00:10:42,578 --> 00:10:44,363
And yes, by the way, it is fast food:

231
00:10:44,387 --> 00:10:45,977
It's sloppy Joes, it's burgers,

232
00:10:46,001 --> 00:10:48,777
it's wieners, it's pizzas, it's all of that stuff.

233
00:10:50,025 --> 00:10:51,464
(Sighs)

234
00:10:52,212 --> 00:10:55,189
Ten percent of what we spend on health care, as I said earlier,

235
00:10:55,213 --> 00:10:57,648
is on obesity, and it's going to double.

236
00:10:58,910 --> 00:11:00,340
We're not teaching our kids.

237
00:11:00,364 --> 00:11:03,069
There's no statutory right to teach kids about food,

238
00:11:03,093 --> 00:11:04,886
elementary or secondary school, OK?

239
00:11:04,910 --> 00:11:07,228
We don't teach kids about food, right?

240
00:11:07,252 --> 00:11:09,681
And this is a little clip from an elementary school,

241
00:11:09,705 --> 00:11:11,284
which is very common in England.

242
00:11:13,760 --> 00:11:15,289
(Video) Who knows what this is?

243
00:11:15,313 --> 00:11:16,384
Child: Potatoes.

244
00:11:16,408 --> 00:11:18,996
Jamie Oliver: Potato? So, you think these are potatoes?

245
00:11:19,020 --> 00:11:20,241
Do you know what that is?

246
00:11:20,554 --> 00:11:21,758
Do you know what that is?

247
00:11:21,782 --> 00:11:22,797
Child: Broccoli?

248
00:11:22,821 --> 00:11:25,277
JO: What about this? Our good old friend.

249
00:11:25,301 --> 00:11:26,461
Child: Celery.

250
00:11:26,485 --> 00:11:28,429
JO: No. What do you think this is?

251
00:11:28,453 --> 00:11:29,937
Child: Onion. JO: Onion? No.

252
00:11:29,961 --> 00:11:32,367
JO: Immediately you get a really clear sense

253
00:11:32,391 --> 00:11:35,611
of "Do the kids know anything about where food comes from?"

254
00:11:35,635 --> 00:11:37,612
Who knows what that is? Child: Uh, pear?

255
00:11:37,636 --> 00:11:40,064
JO: What do you think this is? Child: I don't know.

256
00:11:40,088 --> 00:11:42,072
JO: If the kids don't know what stuff is,

257
00:11:42,096 --> 00:11:43,495
then they will never eat it.

258
00:11:45,683 --> 00:11:46,940
(Laughter)

259
00:11:46,964 --> 00:11:49,736
JO: Normal. England and America,

260
00:11:49,760 --> 00:11:51,298
England and America.

261
00:11:51,322 --> 00:11:53,465
Guess what fixed that.

262
00:11:53,927 --> 00:11:55,400
Two one-hour sessions.

263
00:11:56,971 --> 00:12:00,360
We've got to start teaching our kids about food in schools, period.

264
00:12:01,196 --> 00:12:06,736
(Applause)

265
00:12:06,760 --> 00:12:10,781
I want to tell you about something

266
00:12:10,805 --> 00:12:15,143
that kind of epitomizes the trouble that we're in, guys, OK?

267
00:12:15,167 --> 00:12:17,738
I want to talk about something so basic as milk.

268
00:12:18,402 --> 00:12:20,403
Every kid has the right to milk at school.

269
00:12:20,427 --> 00:12:24,023
Your kids will be having milk at school, breakfast and lunch, right?

270
00:12:24,047 --> 00:12:25,845
They'll be having two bottles, OK?

271
00:12:25,869 --> 00:12:27,362
And most kids do.

272
00:12:27,386 --> 00:12:30,171
But milk ain't good enough anymore.

273
00:12:30,195 --> 00:12:32,736
Don't get me wrong, I support milk --

274
00:12:32,760 --> 00:12:34,876
but someone at the milk board

275
00:12:34,900 --> 00:12:37,570
probably paid a lot of money for some geezer to work out

276
00:12:37,594 --> 00:12:39,335
that if you put loads of flavorings,

277
00:12:39,359 --> 00:12:40,782
colorings and sugar in milk,

278
00:12:40,806 --> 00:12:42,224
more kids will drink it.

279
00:12:43,465 --> 00:12:44,465
Yeah.

280
00:12:44,981 --> 00:12:46,934
Obviously now that's going to catch on

281
00:12:46,958 --> 00:12:48,744
the apple board is going to work out

282
00:12:48,768 --> 00:12:51,545
that if they make toffee apples they'll eat more as well.

283
00:12:51,569 --> 00:12:52,982
Do you know what I mean?

284
00:12:53,006 --> 00:12:56,053
For me, there isn't any need to flavor the milk.

285
00:12:56,077 --> 00:12:58,100
Okay? There's sugar in everything.

286
00:12:58,124 --> 00:13:00,273
I know the ins and outs of those ingredients.

287
00:13:00,297 --> 00:13:01,323
It's in everything.

288
00:13:01,347 --> 00:13:04,925
Even the milk hasn't escaped the kind of modern-day problems.

289
00:13:04,949 --> 00:13:06,736
There's our milk. There's our carton.

290
00:13:06,760 --> 00:13:11,009
In that is nearly as much sugar as one of your favorite cans of fizzy pop,

291
00:13:11,033 --> 00:13:12,469
and they are having two a day.

292
00:13:12,493 --> 00:13:14,048
So, let me just show you.

293
00:13:14,072 --> 00:13:17,154
We've got one kid, here --

294
00:13:18,847 --> 00:13:22,659
having, you know, eight tablespoons of sugar a day.

295
00:13:23,379 --> 00:13:25,505
You know, there's your week.

296
00:13:26,260 --> 00:13:28,116
There's your month.

297
00:13:29,338 --> 00:13:31,533
And I've taken the liberty of putting in

298
00:13:31,557 --> 00:13:34,557
just the five years of elementary school sugar,

299
00:13:38,213 --> 00:13:39,411
just from milk.

300
00:13:42,760 --> 00:13:44,580
Now, I don't know about you guys,

301
00:13:44,604 --> 00:13:47,421
but judging the circumstances, right,

302
00:13:47,445 --> 00:13:49,736
any judge in the whole world,

303
00:13:49,760 --> 00:13:52,224
would look at the statistics and the evidence,

304
00:13:52,248 --> 00:13:55,533
and they would find any government of old guilty of child abuse.

305
00:13:56,088 --> 00:13:57,192
That's my belief.

306
00:13:57,216 --> 00:14:00,216
(Applause)

307
00:14:04,107 --> 00:14:05,736
(Applause ends)

308
00:14:05,760 --> 00:14:09,052
Now, if I came up here, and I wish I could come up here today

309
00:14:09,076 --> 00:14:11,737
and hang a cure for AIDS or cancer,

310
00:14:11,761 --> 00:14:14,211
you'd be fighting and scrambling to get to me.

311
00:14:15,244 --> 00:14:18,220
This, all this bad news, is preventable.

312
00:14:18,760 --> 00:14:20,271
That's the good news.

313
00:14:20,295 --> 00:14:22,271
It's very, very preventable.

314
00:14:23,040 --> 00:14:25,736
So, let's just think about, we got a problem here,

315
00:14:25,760 --> 00:14:26,878
we need to reboot.

316
00:14:28,093 --> 00:14:30,736
Okay so, in my world, what do we need to do?

317
00:14:30,760 --> 00:14:32,475
Here is the thing, right,

318
00:14:32,499 --> 00:14:34,736
it cannot just come from one source.

319
00:14:34,760 --> 00:14:38,167
To reboot and make real tangible change,

320
00:14:38,191 --> 00:14:41,135
real change, so that I could look you in the white of the eyes

321
00:14:41,159 --> 00:14:42,736
and say, "In 10 years' time,

322
00:14:42,760 --> 00:14:44,736
the history of your children's lives,

323
00:14:44,760 --> 00:14:47,808
happiness -- and let's not forget, you're clever if you eat well,

324
00:14:47,832 --> 00:14:49,690
you know you're going to live longer --

325
00:14:49,714 --> 00:14:52,647
all of that stuff, it will look different. OK?"

326
00:14:53,366 --> 00:14:55,072
So, supermarkets.

327
00:14:55,096 --> 00:14:57,016
Where else do you shop so religiously?

328
00:14:57,040 --> 00:14:58,228
Week in, week out.

329
00:14:58,252 --> 00:15:01,331
How much money do you spend, in your life, in a supermarket?

330
00:15:01,355 --> 00:15:02,363
Love them.

331
00:15:02,387 --> 00:15:04,443
They just sell us what we want. All right.

332
00:15:04,467 --> 00:15:08,926
They owe us to put a food ambassador in every major supermarket.

333
00:15:09,442 --> 00:15:11,022
They need to help us shop.

334
00:15:11,046 --> 00:15:14,736
They need to show us how to cook quick, tasty, seasonal meals

335
00:15:14,760 --> 00:15:16,625
for people that are busy.

336
00:15:16,649 --> 00:15:18,618
This is not expensive.

337
00:15:18,642 --> 00:15:21,523
It is done in some, and it needs to be done across the board

338
00:15:21,547 --> 00:15:23,252
in America soon, and quick.

339
00:15:23,624 --> 00:15:26,601
The big brands, you know, the food brands,

340
00:15:26,625 --> 00:15:30,350
need to put food education at the heart of their businesses.

341
00:15:30,374 --> 00:15:32,254
I know, easier said than done.

342
00:15:32,278 --> 00:15:34,489
It's the future. It's the only way.

343
00:15:34,513 --> 00:15:36,134
Fast food.

344
00:15:36,158 --> 00:15:38,918
With the fast-food industry

345
00:15:38,942 --> 00:15:40,736
you know, it's very competitive.

346
00:15:40,760 --> 00:15:42,855
I've had loads of secret papers and dealings

347
00:15:42,879 --> 00:15:44,597
with fast food restaurants.

348
00:15:44,621 --> 00:15:46,438
I know how they do it.

349
00:15:46,462 --> 00:15:48,735
I mean, basically they've weaned us on

350
00:15:48,759 --> 00:15:51,538
to these hits of sugar, salt and fat, and x, y, and z,

351
00:15:51,562 --> 00:15:53,539
and everyone loves them, right?

352
00:15:53,563 --> 00:15:56,759
So, these guys are going to be part of the solution.

353
00:15:56,783 --> 00:15:58,736
But we need to get the government to work

354
00:15:58,760 --> 00:16:01,808
with all of the fast food purveyors and the restaurant industry,

355
00:16:01,832 --> 00:16:03,881
and over a five, six, seven year period

356
00:16:03,905 --> 00:16:06,224
wean of us off the extreme amounts

357
00:16:06,248 --> 00:16:09,736
of fat, sugar and all the other non-food ingredients.

358
00:16:09,760 --> 00:16:12,042
Now, also, back to the sort of big brands:

359
00:16:12,066 --> 00:16:15,248
labeling, I said earlier, is an absolute farce

360
00:16:15,272 --> 00:16:16,683
and has got to be sorted.

361
00:16:18,063 --> 00:16:19,388
OK, school.

362
00:16:20,290 --> 00:16:22,736
Obviously, in schools, we owe it to them

363
00:16:22,760 --> 00:16:24,736
to make sure those 180 days of the year,

364
00:16:24,760 --> 00:16:26,736
from that little precious age of four,

365
00:16:26,760 --> 00:16:28,736
until 18, 20, 24, whatever,

366
00:16:28,760 --> 00:16:33,611
they need to be cooked proper, fresh food

367
00:16:33,635 --> 00:16:35,736
from local growers on site, OK?

368
00:16:35,760 --> 00:16:38,286
There needs to be a new standard of fresh, proper food

369
00:16:38,310 --> 00:16:39,736
for your children, yeah?

370
00:16:39,760 --> 00:16:44,189
(Applause)

371
00:16:44,213 --> 00:16:47,649
Under the circumstances, it's profoundly important

372
00:16:47,673 --> 00:16:50,242
that every single American child leaves school

373
00:16:50,266 --> 00:16:52,243
knowing how to cook 10 recipes

374
00:16:52,267 --> 00:16:53,616
that will save their life.

375
00:16:54,760 --> 00:16:55,839
Life skills.

376
00:16:55,863 --> 00:16:58,060
(Applause)

377
00:16:58,084 --> 00:17:01,122
That means that they can be students, young parents,

378
00:17:01,146 --> 00:17:05,385
and be able to sort of duck and dive around the basics of cooking,

379
00:17:05,409 --> 00:17:07,512
no matter what recession hits them next time.

380
00:17:07,536 --> 00:17:09,918
If you can cook, recession money doesn't matter.

381
00:17:09,942 --> 00:17:12,413
If you can cook, time doesn't matter.

382
00:17:13,955 --> 00:17:16,400
The workplace, we haven't really talked about it.

383
00:17:16,424 --> 00:17:19,986
You know, it's now time for corporate responsibility

384
00:17:20,010 --> 00:17:24,034
to really look at what they feed or make available to their staff.

385
00:17:24,058 --> 00:17:27,368
The staff are the moms and dads of America's children.

386
00:17:27,392 --> 00:17:29,551
Marissa, her father died in her hand,

387
00:17:29,575 --> 00:17:31,552
I think she'd be quite happy

388
00:17:31,576 --> 00:17:34,736
if corporate America could start feeding their staff properly.

389
00:17:34,760 --> 00:17:36,736
Definitely they shouldn't be left out.

390
00:17:36,760 --> 00:17:38,326
Let's go back to the home.

391
00:17:38,350 --> 00:17:40,590
Now, look, if we do all this stuff, and we can,

392
00:17:40,614 --> 00:17:41,687
it's so achievable.

393
00:17:41,711 --> 00:17:43,453
You can care and be commercial.

394
00:17:43,477 --> 00:17:44,500
Absolutely.

395
00:17:44,524 --> 00:17:49,519
But the home needs to start passing on cooking again, for sure.

396
00:17:49,543 --> 00:17:51,519
For sure, pass it on as a philosophy.

397
00:17:52,033 --> 00:17:53,677
And for me, it's quite romantic,

398
00:17:53,701 --> 00:17:56,094
but it's about if one person teaches three people

399
00:17:56,118 --> 00:17:57,736
how to cook something,

400
00:17:57,760 --> 00:17:59,500
and they teach three of their mates,

401
00:17:59,524 --> 00:18:01,848
that only has to repeat itself 25 times,

402
00:18:01,872 --> 00:18:04,127
and that's the whole population of America.

403
00:18:04,151 --> 00:18:08,451
Romantic, yes, but most importantly,

404
00:18:08,475 --> 00:18:11,166
it's about trying to get people to realize

405
00:18:11,190 --> 00:18:14,174
that every one of your individual efforts makes a difference.

406
00:18:14,198 --> 00:18:16,398
We've got to put back what's been lost.

407
00:18:16,892 --> 00:18:18,114
Huntington's Kitchen.

408
00:18:18,755 --> 00:18:21,026
Huntington, where I made this program,

409
00:18:21,050 --> 00:18:22,637
we've got this prime-time program

410
00:18:22,661 --> 00:18:25,849
that hopefully will inspire people to really get on this change.

411
00:18:25,873 --> 00:18:27,904
I truly believe that change will happen.

412
00:18:27,928 --> 00:18:30,095
Huntington's Kitchen. I work with a community.

413
00:18:30,119 --> 00:18:31,600
I worked in the schools.

414
00:18:31,624 --> 00:18:33,889
I found local sustainable funding

415
00:18:33,913 --> 00:18:38,199
to get every single school in the area from the junk, onto the fresh food:

416
00:18:38,223 --> 00:18:40,092
six-and-a-half grand per school.

417
00:18:40,760 --> 00:18:41,966
(Applause)

418
00:18:41,990 --> 00:18:44,486
That's all it takes, six-and-a-half grand per school.

419
00:18:44,510 --> 00:18:46,913
The Kitchen is 25 grand a month. Okay?

420
00:18:46,937 --> 00:18:49,812
This can do 5,000 people a year,

421
00:18:49,836 --> 00:18:51,954
which is 10 percent of their population,

422
00:18:51,978 --> 00:18:53,359
and it's people on people.

423
00:18:53,383 --> 00:18:55,684
You know, it's local cooks teaching local people.

424
00:18:55,708 --> 00:18:59,294
It's free cooking lessons, guys, in the Main Street.

425
00:19:00,100 --> 00:19:03,447
This is real, tangible change, real, tangible change.

426
00:19:04,244 --> 00:19:07,266
Around America, if we just look back now,

427
00:19:07,290 --> 00:19:09,693
there is plenty of wonderful things going on.

428
00:19:10,394 --> 00:19:12,503
There is plenty of beautiful things going on.

429
00:19:12,527 --> 00:19:15,736
There are angels around America doing great things

430
00:19:15,760 --> 00:19:18,657
in schools -- farm-to-school set-ups,

431
00:19:18,681 --> 00:19:21,292
garden set-ups, education --

432
00:19:21,316 --> 00:19:23,413
there are amazing people doing this already.

433
00:19:23,437 --> 00:19:25,366
The problem is they all want to roll out

434
00:19:25,390 --> 00:19:27,525
what they're doing to the next school,

435
00:19:27,549 --> 00:19:28,897
but there's no cash.

436
00:19:29,817 --> 00:19:33,517
We need to recognize the experts and the angels quickly,

437
00:19:33,541 --> 00:19:36,736
identify them, and allow them to easily find the resource

438
00:19:36,760 --> 00:19:39,000
to keep rolling out what they're already doing,

439
00:19:39,024 --> 00:19:40,024
and doing well.

440
00:19:40,608 --> 00:19:42,880
Businesses of America need to support

441
00:19:42,904 --> 00:19:45,736
Mrs. Obama to do the things that she wants to do.

442
00:19:45,760 --> 00:19:52,159
(Applause)

443
00:19:52,183 --> 00:19:54,129
And look, I know it's weird

444
00:19:54,153 --> 00:19:56,736
having an English person standing here before you

445
00:19:56,760 --> 00:19:58,201
talking about all this.

446
00:19:58,225 --> 00:19:59,573
All I can say is: I care.

447
00:20:00,129 --> 00:20:01,551
I'm a father,

448
00:20:01,575 --> 00:20:02,916
and I love this country.

449
00:20:03,760 --> 00:20:06,362
And I believe truly, actually,

450
00:20:06,386 --> 00:20:09,235
that if change can be made in this country,

451
00:20:09,259 --> 00:20:11,442
beautiful things will happen around the world.

452
00:20:11,466 --> 00:20:13,601
If America does it, other people will follow.

453
00:20:13,625 --> 00:20:15,021
It's incredibly important.

454
00:20:15,397 --> 00:20:16,465
(Audience) Yeah!

455
00:20:16,489 --> 00:20:22,120
(Applause)

456
00:20:22,144 --> 00:20:23,422
When I was in Huntington,

457
00:20:23,446 --> 00:20:26,070
trying to get a few things to work when they weren't,

458
00:20:26,094 --> 00:20:31,405
I thought "If I had a magic wand, what would I do?"

459
00:20:31,429 --> 00:20:32,986
And I thought, "You know what?

460
00:20:33,010 --> 00:20:36,293
I'd just love to be put in front of some of the most amazing

461
00:20:36,317 --> 00:20:38,081
movers and shakers in America."

462
00:20:39,001 --> 00:20:42,088
And a month later, TED phoned me up and gave me this award.

463
00:20:43,553 --> 00:20:44,608
I'm here.

464
00:20:47,275 --> 00:20:48,457
So, my wish.

465
00:20:53,495 --> 00:20:55,257
Dyslexic, so I'm a bit slow.

466
00:21:00,760 --> 00:21:02,736
My wish

467
00:21:02,760 --> 00:21:06,891
is for you to help a strong, sustainable movement

468
00:21:06,915 --> 00:21:10,589
to educate every child

469
00:21:10,613 --> 00:21:13,001
about food,

470
00:21:13,025 --> 00:21:16,540
to inspire families to cook again,

471
00:21:16,564 --> 00:21:19,225
and to empower people everywhere

472
00:21:19,249 --> 00:21:20,772
to fight obesity.

473
00:21:21,760 --> 00:21:24,864
(Applause)

474
00:21:32,003 --> 00:21:33,056
Thank you.

475
00:21:33,080 --> 00:21:36,080
(Applause continues)
