## To build your code, please run:
```
make
```

## hw0201
### Wildcard Matching
> All functions are in "mymatch.h". There are some function prototype:
```c
int mymatch(char ***pppList, const char *pStr, const char *pPattern);
```
> It can use wildcard matching in each of strings that splited by space. If string matchs by pattern that you set, it will be store in pppList. The return value is number of matching.

> If you want to execute it, you will need to add new file named "hw0201.c" by yourself.

## hw0202
### IEEE 754
> Use union to share memory of double precision, assign bit field of struct in union and follow IEEE754 rule. It can be get difference value in memory by that each of you field.Then, print them as binary to show result.

> If you want to execute it, typing the command below:
```
./hw0202
```

## hw0203
### Puella Magi Madoka Magica
> All functions are in "madoka.h". Please reference function prototype in headerfile. There are too many prototype to list below...

> It's a anime? or a game? In fact, I even don't know how to explain this one...... So, it's look like a RPG game.

> If you want to execute it, you will need to add new file named "hw0203.c" by yourself.

## hw0204
### Mixed Fraction Arithmetic
> It's the integer and fraction with latex-formate anaysis of caculator. You must follow fraction rules to input your string. And you also have to follow latex-formate. Otherwise, it will be caused error. This program is using struct to store each element of fraction. First analysis string that you input and store. Then caculate the answer with following base-mathematics-rule.

> If you want to execute it, typing the command below:
```
./hw0204
```

## hw0205
### Vectors
> All functions are in "myvector.h". Please reference function prototype in headerfile. There are too many prototype to list below...

> unfinished.......

> If you want to execute it, you will need to add new file named "hw0205.c" by yourself.
